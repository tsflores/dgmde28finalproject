# TMDB Clone

Uses TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/) to create a Netflix like application that allows user to see TV and Movie listings.  TMDB has an API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/configuration-details) with information about thousands of movies and TV shows.

The app is structured as:
    1. Conssitent navigation
    2. Home page that renders Trending TV shows, current movie showings, and upcoming movie listings per TMDB's time period.  
    3. Watchlist page that illustrates shows and minor details that the user has selected
    4. Search page that allows the user to look for a specific show - a list of any shows with the search criteria will then get rendered on the page
    5. Details page that comes up when a user clicks on an image of a TV show.  The page provides more detailed information including cast and recommendations
    6. Local storage that allows watch list to persist.
